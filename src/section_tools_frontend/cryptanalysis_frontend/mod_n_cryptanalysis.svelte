<Info title="About Modulo N Cryptanalysis" links={modNLinks}>

    Mod N cryptanalysis is an attack that exploits modular arithmetic properties in cryptographic\n
    algorithms and is applicable to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher'>block</a> and 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher'>stream ciphers</a>. It is primarily used to attack cryptographic 
    schemes that rely on modular exponentiation or modular reductions (such as RSA). It was first introduced in 1999 
    by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kelsey_(cryptanalyst)'>John Kelsey</a>, 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier'>Bruce Schneier</a>, 
    and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Wagner'>David Wagner</a>.

    <b> Example: Mod n cryptanalysis in RC5 </b> <br>
    RC5 operates on 32-bit words (or 16/64 bit words) and relies on modular addition, xor operation, and left rotation. An attacker can exploit the 
    structure of modular addition for cryptanalysis
    <p>In RC5, the round function includes: A = (A <span>&#8853;</span> B) <span>&#8920;</span> B <b>and</b> B = (B <span>&#8853;</span> A) <span>&#8920;</span> A. 
    However, before rotation, modular addition introduces carry bits that may leak information. A cryptanalyst might exploit how carry propagation behaves under mod 2<sup>w</sup> 
    (where w is the word size/bits).</p>
    <p>If two plaintexts differ by a multiple of 2<sup>w</sup>, their encryption outputs might reveal a pattern. By choosing plaintext pairs where differences cancel out modulo 
    2<sup>w</sup>, an attacker can detect when a carry occurs, reducing key search space. If we analyze modular addition carry propagation, we can find differential pairs that 
    remain unchanged mod 2<sup>w</sup>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Choose plaintexts P1,P2 where P1≡P2 mod 2<sup>w</sup>.</li>
    <li>Observe output difference C1-C2 mod 2<sup>w</sup>.</li>
    <li>If no carry is introduced, we can predict part of the round function behavior.</li>
    <li>Repeat this to recover key bits by solving for when modular carries occur.</li>
    </ul>
    RC5 is designed to resist most modular arithmetic attacks, but mod 2<sup>w</sup> cryptanalysis can reveal patterns in modular addition 
    carry propagation, assist in differential cryptanalysis and reduce key search space using modular equivalence. <br><br>
