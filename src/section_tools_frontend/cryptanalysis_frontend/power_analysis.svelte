<Info title="About Power Analysis" links={paLinks}>

    <b>Power Analysis</b> is a type of side-channel attack that exploits variations 
    in the power consumption of a cryptographic device, like a smartcard, CPU, or other hardware, during 
    cryptographic operations (such as encryption or decryption). The goal is to extract sensitive information
    like cryptographic keys by analyzing how the device's power usage changes while performing operations. 
    This method of attack is powerful because it doesn't require access to the device's internal memory or code; 
    instead, it leverages information that can be obtained from the physical device, making it a significant 
    concern in secure hardware design. There are 3 types of power analysis: 
    <ol>
    <li><b>Simple Power Analysis (SPA): </b>SPA involves directly observing the power consumption of a device during cryptographic operations.</li>
    <li><b>Differential Power Analysis (DPA): </b>DPA is a more advanced and sophisticated form of power analysis. 
    It involves statistically analyzing the power consumption during multiple cryptographic operations and comparing power traces taken from different inputs or states.</li>
    <li><b>Higher-Order Differential Power Analysis (HO-DPA): </b>HO-DPA is an advanced form of DPA attack, but is less widely practiced than SPA and DPA.</li>
    </ol>
