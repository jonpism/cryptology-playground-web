<Info title="About Rubber Hose Cryptanalysis (Deniable Encryption)" links={rhcLinks}>

    <b>Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</b> is the practice of extracting cryptographic secrets 
    through coercion, such as threats, torture, or intimidation, rather than using mathematical or 
    computational attacks. It is a play on words, implying that instead of using advanced cryptanalysis, 
    an attacker could simply beat the keyholder with a rubber hose until they reveal the decryption key.<br>
    Deniable encryption is specifically designed to counter rubber-hose cryptanalysis by allowing users 
    to plausibly deny the existence of sensitive data. Here's how: 
    <ul>
    <li>A <b>deniable encryption system</b> allows the same encrypted data to be decrypted into different plaintexts depending on the key used.</li>
    <li>If forced to reveal a key, the user can provide a decoy key that decrypts to harmless data, making it impossible to prove whether additional hidden data exists.</li>
    <li>Systems like <b>VeraCrypt’s hidden volumes</b> allow users to store sensitive files inside an encrypted container that itself contains a visible, less important set of files.</li>
    <li>Even if coerced to provide a password, the user can reveal only the decoy container while keeping the true hidden volume secret.</li>
    <li>Some deniable encryption schemes are used in secure messaging protocols to ensure that even if a user is forced to decrypt a message, they can plausibly claim that the decrypted text was the only message.</li>
    </ul>
