<Info title="About Related-Key Attack" links={rkaLinks}>

    A <b>related-key attack</b> is a type of cryptanalysis that exploits predictable 
    relationships between multiple encryption keys used in a cryptographic system. Instead of 
    attacking a cipher with a single known key, an attacker analyzes how the algorithm behaves 
    under different but related keys to extract information about the secret key or plaintext. 
    <ul>
    <li>The attacker gains access to encryptions (or decryptions) performed with multiple keys that have some known mathematical relationship.</li>
    <li>By studying the patterns or differences in output, they try to deduce the structure of the secret key or find weaknesses in the encryption algorithm.</li>
    <li>If successful, they can recover parts of the secret key or reduce the effective security of the encryption scheme.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>The Related-Key Attack:</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Exploits relationships between keys</b> rather than direct brute-force or statistical analysis of ciphertexts.</li>
    <li><b>Is more effective on weak key scheduling algorithms</b> (e.g., ciphers where small changes in the key lead to predictable changes in encryption output).</li>
    <li><b>Is particularly dangerous for block ciphers</b> with poor key expansion functions.</li>
    </ul>
