<Info title="About Known-Plaintext Analysis" links={kpaLinks}>

    In this type of attack, some plaintext-ciphertext pairs are already known. 
    Attacker maps them in order to find the encryption algorithm or the encryption key. This attack 
    is easier to use as a lot of information is already available. To exploit plaintext and ciphertext 
    two common techniques are used: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis'>frequency analysis</a> 
    and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching'>pattern matching</a>. <br><br>
    <b>Example: Known-Plaintext attack in Caesar Cipher</b><br>
    Let's say Alice and Bob are communicating using a Caesar cipher, and Eve, 
    the attacker, intercepts some encrypted messages. Eve also manages to obtain the original plaintext of one message. 
    She uses this information to decrypt other messages. <br><br>
    Eve intercepts this ciphertext message: Wklv lv d vhfuhw phvvdjh. She also somehow acquires the corresponding plaintext: 
    This is a secret message. <br><br>
    By comparing plaintext and ciphertext, Eve deduces the shift: <br>
    T -> W, h -> k, i -> l, s -> v, etc. Each letter is shifted +3 positions in the alphabet, meaning Caesar cipher 
    with a shift of 3 was used. Now, for each ciphertext message Eve intercepts, she will shift back -3 to decrypt. <br><br>
