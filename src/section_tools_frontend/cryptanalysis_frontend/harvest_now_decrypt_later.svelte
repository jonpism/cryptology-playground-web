<Info title="About Harvest now, Decrypt later" links={hndlLinks}>

    Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) Attacks refer to a cybersecurity threat 
    where attackers collect and store encrypted data today with the expectation that future 
    advancements—particularly in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing'>quantum computing</a>-
    will allow them to decrypt it later. This is a major concern for organizations handling sensitive data, as 
    encryption methods that are secure today may become obsolete in the future. 
    <ul>
    <li>Attackers intercept and store encrypted data through network eavesdropping, cyber espionage, or breaches.</li>
    <li>The encrypted data is kept for years or even decades.</li>
    <li>When quantum computers become powerful enough, they can break widely used encryption algorithms (like <b>RSA</b> and <b>ECC</b>) using algorithms such as <b>Shor's algorithm</b>.</li>
    <li>Once decryption is feasible, attackers access sensitive information, which could include government secrets, financial records, intellectual property, or personal data.</li>
    </ul>
