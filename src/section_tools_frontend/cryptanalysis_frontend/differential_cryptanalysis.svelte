    This type of attack involves comparing pairs of plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts 
    to find patterns in the encryption algorithm. It can be effective against block ciphers (with certain properties) 
    and some stream ciphers. It was publicly introduced by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Biham'>Eli Biham</a> 
    and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir'>Adi Shamir</a> in the late 1980s but was known to the National 
    Security Agency (NSA) much earlier.
    <ul>
    <li>The attacker selects pairs of plaintexts with a specific difference (XOR difference).</li>
    <li>The attacker studies how these input differences propagate through the encryption rounds.</li>
    <li>Some differences appear more frequently at certain points in the cipher, revealing patterns.</li>
    <li>By analyzing these biases, the attacker can deduce parts of the key and gradually recover the full key.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Example: Attack on a simple Feister Cipher</b><br>
    Assume we have a 4-round Feistel cipher with <b>64-bit plaintext, 32-bit Feistel function F and XOR operation.</b><br>
    We choose two plaintexts P and P' that have a specific XOR difference. Let's say:
    <ul>
    <li>P = (Lo, Ro) and P' = (L'o, R'o)</li>
    <li><b>Input Difference:</b> ΔRo = R0 ⊕ R'o (chosen by attacker)</li>
    <li>ΔLo = 0 (no difference in Lo)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>For the first round:</b> (K1=key)
    <ul>
    <li>Compute L1 = Ro</li>
    <li>Compute R1 = Lo ⊕ F(Ro, K1)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>For the second plaintext:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Compute L'1 = R'o</li>
    <li>Compute R'1 = L'o ⊕ F(R'o, K1)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Taking the XOR difference:</b><br>
    ΔL1 = L1 ⊕ L'1 = Ro ⊕ R'o = ΔRo  <b>and</b> ΔR1 = R1 ⊕ R'1 = F(Ro, K1) ⊕ F(R'o, K1)<br><br>
    Since the attacker chooses ΔRo, they can analyze how the Feistel function F propagates differences.
    If <b>F</b> has a predictable differential pattern, <b>the attacker can guess parts of the key K1.</b> 
    By repeating this attack with many plaintext pairs, the attacker can determine which key bits 
    are more likely, eventually recovering the full key.<br><br>
