<Info title="About Ciphertext-Only Analysis" links={coaLinks}>

    In this type of attack, only some cipher-text is known and the attacker 
    tries to find the corresponding encryption key and plaintext. Its the hardest to implement 
    but is the most probable attack as only ciphertext is required. Most common methods used in 
    a ciphertext-only attack are: frequency analysis, statistical analysis, dictionary attacks.
    <ul>
    <li>The attacker has no knowledge of the plaintext or the encryption key.</li>
    <li>The only available information is one or more ciphertexts.</li>
    <li>The goal is to infer information about the plaintexts or recover the encryption key.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Example: Ciphertext-only attack with frequency analysis</b><br>
    Let's say Eve (the attacker) intercepts the encrypted message: <b>WKH HDJOH KDV ODQGHG</b>. 
    She does not know the plaintext or the encryption key, she only has the ciphertext. 
    She suspects Caesar Cipher is used and she is going to analyze the ciphertext. 
    Eve applies frequency analysis. The most common letter in English is <b>E</b>, followed by <b>T, A, O, I, N ,S.</b> 
    By checking which letters appear most frequently in the ciphertext, Eve can guess the shift. 
    If we analyze the ciphertext and assume that the letter <b>E</b> maps to <b>H</b>, that suggests a shift of <b>+3.</b> 
    Since we suspect a shift of +3, shifting each letter backward by 3 in the alphabet gives: <b>THE EAGLE HAS LANDED</b>.<br><br>
